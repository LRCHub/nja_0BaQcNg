[00:12.26] Ooh
[00:15.63] Balloons are deflated
[00:19.42] Guess they look lifeless like me
[00:23.24] We miss you on your side of the bed, mmm
[00:30.63] Still got your things here
[00:33.93] And they stare at me like souvenirs
[00:37.88] Don't wanna let you out my head
[00:43.81] Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
[00:48.07] Said that you love me, but that'll last for never
[00:51.70] It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
[00:55.44] Why you walk out my life?
[00:59.17] I get like this every time
[01:05.51] On these days that feel like you and me
[01:10.20] Heartbreak anniversary
[01:13.73] 'Cause I remember every time
[01:20.34] On these days that feel like you and me
[01:24.93] Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
[01:31.70] (Oh-ooh) No
[01:36.60] (Ooh) No, no, no
[01:39.73] (Ooh, ooh) Ooh, nah (Ooh)
[01:44.32] I'm buildin' my hopes up
[01:47.81] Like presents unopened 'til this day
[01:51.54] I still see the messages you read, mmm
[01:59.02] I'm foolishly patient (Foolishly patient)
[02:02.64] Can't get past the taste of your lips (Taste of your lips)
[02:06.73] Don't wanna let you out my head
[02:12.54] Just like the day that I met you, the day I thought forever
[02:16.73] Said that you love me but that'll last for never
[02:20.28] It's cold outside like when you walked out my life
[02:22.50] Why you walk out my life? (My life)
[02:27.65] I get like this every time
[02:34.34] On these days that feel like you and me
[02:38.77] Heartbreak anniversary
[02:42.33] 'Cause I remember every time
[02:48.79] On these days that feel like you and me
[02:53.57] Heartbreak anniversary, do you ever think of me?
[03:00.47] (Oh-ooh) Of me
[03:04.13] (Ooh) 'Cause I think of you, think of you
[03:09.02] (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
